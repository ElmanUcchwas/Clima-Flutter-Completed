## The goal

The objective  is to show asynchronous programming in Dart. I'll look at how to carry out time consuming tasks such as getting device location and networking to get data from the internet.


## What I will create

I am going to make a weather app inspired by the beautiful designs made by [Olia Gozha](https://dribbble.com/shots/4663154-). By the end of the module, I'll be able to find out the live weather data in the current location of the device as well as the weather for any city you can think of!



## The process

- Using Dart to perform asynchronous tasks.
- Understanding async and await.
- How to network with the Dart http package.
- Getting APIs using them to get data from the internet.
- Using JSONs and parse them using the Dart convert package.
- Passing data forwards and backwards between screens using the Navigator.
- Handling exceptions in Dart using try/catch/throw.
- Using the lifecycle of Stateful Widgets and overriding them.
- Using Geolocator package to get live location data for Android.
- Using TextField Widget to take user input.
